   <h1>Starbucks</h1>
   <p>Hey, I lied a little......... Sorry</p>
   <h4>It is one of my top two favortite places (next to wawa) but it really isnt local</h4>
   <h4>If you didnt know who they are here is what they say about themselves.</h4>
   <h5>"Expect more than coffee.
      From the beginning, Starbucks set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee but also connection. <br>
      We’re a neighborhood gathering place, a part of your daily routine. Get to know us and you’ll see: we are so much more than what we brew. <br>
      We call our employees partners because we are all partners in shared success. We make sure everything we do is through the lens of humanity—from our <br>
      commitment to the highest-quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly." </h5>
   <h4>Dont forget, we can save the world one over priced coffee at a time!!!</h4>
   <h4><small>that was a joke haha</h4>
